The lady, hobbling,
walking along the cold hard road,
she looked for the merchant,
who always sold,
the golden apple. beautiful and rare,
the old lady wanted it, and never would share,
the riches she made, the  riches she accumalated,
promised immortality the apple did,
thus here she was, in the shop,
the merchant gave a small smirk, 
knowing her purpose he took it out,
and gave the old lady what she wanted, 
it was then she realised,
immortality came... at a great price
so now she lived in the candy house, 
cursed to wait till people came,
to take her place.
